        <strong>
          <em>
            In P.S.21 I was a good student with a majority of my teachers impressed by me. One of the main things I want to talk about if my 5th grade experiance it was all fun being taught by our teacher. But the grades and final report card is what shocked me. I got straight A's in my final grade.

        <strong>
          <em>
            In U Prep I was also a good student was good grades and I was just cruising. At the end my final gpa was 96.3 a good grade I was impressed to. Something else important was the fact I always made honor roll through all 4 quaters. Q1 I got Gold honor roll. Q2 I got Silver honor roll which is right below gold. In Q3 I got Gold honor roll. Finally in Q4 I got gold honor roll. The way the system works is Nothing to Silver to Gold being the highest.
